This program runs from the GaussianElimination.java file and uses the
custom built Worker class for the parallel implementation. There are no
necessary program arguments. By default, it will run the 256.txt test file
along with randomly generated tests. This can be changed by changing the
values of the private static variables at the top of the class.
There is more explanation about that in the code.
